<p>Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will <strong>compound</strong> into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.</p>
<p> “To write a good book, you must first become the book.”</p>
<p>Cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>
<p>What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into somthing much more.</p>
<p>We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now.What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the right path toward success.</p>
<p>You get what you repeat.</p>
<p>Cancer spend 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.</p>
<p>All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</p>
<p>The task of breaking a bad habbit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us.</p>
<p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve.Systems are about the processes that lead to those goals.</p>
<p>“The score takes care of itself.”</p>
<p>Winners and losers have the same goals – survivorship bias.</p>
<p>You treated a symtom without addressing the cause.</p>
<p><strong>Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</strong></p>
<p>The more evidence you have for a belief , the more strongly you will believe it.</p>
<p>As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.</p>
<p>Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.</p>
<p>Try, fail, learn , try differently.</p>
<p>When you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus onn new challenges and master the next set of problems.</p>
<p>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.</p>
<p>Noticing , wanting ,obtaining the reward.</p>
<p><strong>Make it obvious , Make it attractive , Make it easy, Make it satisfying.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make it invinsible, Make it unattractive, Make it difficult, Make it unsatisfying.</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve got my keys.I’ve got my wallet.I’ve got my glasses.I’ve got my husband.” – Pointing and Calling.</p>
<p>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is <strong>maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.</strong></p>
<p>Making a list of your daily actions helps you know what you are doing consciously.</p>
<p><strong>“Does this habbit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”</strong></p>
<p>The process of behavior change always starts with <strong>awareness</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>“I WILL [BEHAVE] IN [TIME] ON [LOCATION]”</strong> – IMPLEMENTATION INTENSIONS</p>
<p><strong>“AFTER DOING [CURRENT HABIT], I WILL DO [NEW HABBIT]”</strong> –HABIT STACKING – DIDEROT’S EFFECT</p>
<p>Many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.  – We’re more likely to buy what you see instead of what you need in supermarket.</p>
<p>When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.– less usage of electricity of Dutch</p>
<p>Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.</p>
<p>Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.</p>
<p>When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits – and the easier ones will usually win out.</p>
<p>Every habit should have a home.</p>
<p>They <strong>spend less time in <em>tempting situations</em>.</strong></p>
<p>One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habbit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</p>
<p>Red dots on the fake beak for herring gulls and the valleyball that a greylag goose rolls. </p>
<p>“We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons” – Why we love to eat junk food?</p>
<p>Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.</p>
<p>The reward system that is activated in the brain when you <em>receive</em> a reward is the same system that is activated when you <em>anticipate</em> a reward.</p>
<p>Temptation bundling works by <strong>linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</strong></p>
<p>“AFTER DOING [HABIT I NEED], I WILL [HABBIT I WANT]” – Premack’s Principle</p>
<p>Only do what you want after finishing what you need.</p>
<p>Pause the Netflix if I stop pedalling.</p>
<p>The consequences of bad habits are dealyed while the rewards are immediate.</p>
<p>It is always easier to continue doing something than start to do something.</p>
<p>The costs of your good habits are in the present.The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p>
<p>“I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse.”</p>
<p>The mark of whether you are made for a task is <strong>not whether you love it</strong> but <strong>whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people</strong>.</p>
<p>When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining?</p>
<p><strong>Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work.They clarify it.They tell us what to work hard on.</p>
<p>They still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.</p>
<p>When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.</p>
<p>If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it.</p>
<p>The reward only comes after the energy is spent.</p>
